                        and sisters)
                        of children with autism. Twin and family studies have shown that younger brothers and sisters of

                        with autism are at a higher risk of also developing autism than those children that do not have

                        with this condition. Therefore by studying younger brothers and sisters of children with autism,

                        have overall brain overgrowth by age 2 years. One
                        large study of head circumference by our group suggests that this overgrowth begins (on average)
                        around 12
                        months of age. We therefore propose to conduct an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) brain scan of
                        children
                        at risk for autism (i.e., younger brothers and sisters of older autistic individuals) at around
                        3 months
                        of age, with repeat scans through 24 months of age. In addition to targeting brothers and
                        sisters of autistic
                        individuals, we will use newly developed behavioral assessment tools and parental questionnaires
                        to help
                        us identify infants at risk for autism. Through the use of MRI technology we will capture images
                        of the brain
                        and perform sophisticated brain measurements. The data gathered in this study will provide
                        important information
                        regarding early brain development in autism, which may in turn provide clues that will
                        eventually result
                        in early rationale interventions (e.g., early behavioral or medication treatments) to improve
                        outcomes for
                        children with autism.

                        have begun looking at younger siblings of children
                        with autism. While your child most likely does not have a diagnosis of autism, past family
                        studies have found
                        that siblings of a person with autism are at a higher risk for having autistic disorder than
                        members of the
                        general population. Most recently, results from our MRI study of brain development in 2 year
                        olds showed
                        that brain enlargement is already present at a young age in children with autism. The data
                        collected suggest
                        that brain overgrowth may begin as early as 12 months of age, if not earlier. This current
                        project aims to
                        identify very early brain features that may be characteristic of infants at risk for autism.
